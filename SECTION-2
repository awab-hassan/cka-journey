1. Cluster Architecture

Suppose there are two ships (letâ€™s consider one master node and the other one worker node). The master node is reponsible for handling all operation and it controlls the other worker nodes. Master node contains: 

- Controller Manager (is a node controller, replication controller etc)
- ETCD (stores information about the cluster e.g brain of cluster)
- Kube Scheduller (responsible for scheduling applications or containers on pods)
- Kube-API server (reponsible for ochestrating all operations in the cluster)

Worker node contains:

- Worker nodes hosts the application in container.
- Kubelet is like the captain of the ship who listens to the commands (from Kube API server) and performs the following actions.
- kube-proxy handles the communication between services in cluster
